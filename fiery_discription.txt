Crunches complex viewmodel and 3rd person animations into efficient, correct SWEP status animations , as-well as handling playback rates, sounds, Idling, and ironsights

Dual wielded weapons are supported and intuitive, using Right and Left mouse controls for fire

When enabled, weapons won't use Ironsights, and will instead use [b]Aim Assist[/b]!
• Uses the con var: swep_AutoAim (0 or 1)
• Weapons held when this var is flipped need to be re-drawn to work
• Aim assist is currently unbiased, but is planned to look at player teams for future filtering
• When close enough to enemies, aim assist will aim for the head

Weapons cannot fire underwater unless specified (USP & MP5 Navy can)

When firing rapidly, bullets start to rise upward to accommodate recoil animations! 

SWEPs can break down doors at certian ranges. Shotguns will do this by default

SWEPs can ignite close targets (where enabled)

Ability to drop a weapons magazine with full animations great for RP (Shotguns have animations for this in works) (Akimbos currently are being looked at for alternative key combos for this)
• (Drop weapon may be added as well)
• To use this, Hold Right Mouse + E + R

Magazine gibs will be dropped according to the SWEPS view model name or explicit mag type (self.Mag = mdl)
Self.NoMag overrides this if true!

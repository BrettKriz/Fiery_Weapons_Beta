I'm here today to unveil a long term personal project that's still in the works, but is ready for general testing and usage,
================================================== ==================================================
• Fiery Weapons Base •
ALPHA 2.0
================================================== ==================================================

This swep base was created from weapon_cs_base and is designed for common swep needs (covered below), most of which are for RP.

Keep in mind that this is ONLY AN ALPHA, and is NOT Final

The weapon pack includes all of the C_model cstrike models, as well as some custom weapons, and even a DoD:S colt (for fun)!

the base supports dual wielded weapons, burst rifles, permanent silenced weapons, MG's, empty weapon animations, and soon will support melee and thrown weapons.



Download on Workshop!




ANIMATION
================================================== ==================================================
Hold type fix included
Hold type aliases included

Dynamic animation execution for View Model animations and 3rd person animations

Animation engine
• Crunches complex viewmodel and 3rd person animations into efficient, correct SWEP status animations , as-well as handling playback rates, sounds, Idling, and ironsights
• Called with VMact( anim_name, pbr, snd, volume, idle_after, iron_off )
• Can also be called with any number of missing or null values!
• anim_name can be either an enumeration, a string of an enumeration, or a shortcut string like "PRIMARY" "SECONDARY" "DRYFIRE" "RELOAD" "DRAW" "IDLE"
• SWEP.ReloadSound handles any reload sounds that need to be played
• SWEP.DrawSound handles any draw/deploy sounds that need to be played


Multiple animation assignment for weapons (See Fiery Tags for in code names)
• Ironsigh holdtypes (IE holding an AK as "ar2" even tho its hipfire is "shotgun")
• Hipfire holdtypes (When not aiming or reloading)
• Reload holdtypes (IE reloading an "ar2 "held M4 as "smg")

3rd Person animations
• All holdtypes are fixed and backwards compatible
• When drawing swep, hold type is set to nothing for 80% of the view models draw sequence, a notable RP feature
• When going into or out of ironsights the hold type changes to show players aiming down the sights, or holding it at the hip/non-sighting


FUNCTIONALITIES
================================================== ==================================================

Streamlined weapon delays and actions for better interaction

Ironsights (and similar data) will eventually become completely client controlled via files, currently waiting for data schemes to be considered

Ability to drop a weapons magazine with full animations great for RP (Shotguns have animations for this in works) (Akimbos currently are being looked at for alternative key combos for this)
• (Drop weapon may be added as well)
• To use this, Hold Right Mouse + E + R

Fire modes to come, currently designing schemas and considering button combos.

Sniper scopes are planned to be added, and are currently unfinished :/

Dual wielded weapons are supported and intuitive, using Right and Left mouse controls for fire

SWEPs can break down doors at certian ranges. Shotguns will do this by default

SWEPs can ignite close targets (where enabled)

When enabled, weapons won't use Ironsights, and will instead use Aim Assist!
• Uses the con var: swep_AutoAim (0 or 1)
• Weapons held when this var is flipped need to be re-drawn to work
• Aim assist is currently unbiased, but is planned to look at player teams for future filtering
• When close enough to enemies, aim assist will aim for the head

Weapon heat is in development for use later on; Should be available by beta

Weapons cannot fire underwater unless specified (USP & MP5 Navy can)

Automatic weapons experience some variance in shoot delay The current setting is fairly higher,

When firing rapidly, bullets start to rise upward to accommodate recoil animations!

New function: ShootBullet
• Takes more arguments and will tie in with physics calculations to come

New function: ShootPhysicalBullet
• Takes same # of arguments as ShootBullet (Further arguments dont need to be passed)
• Shoots a physical projectile using a stock model and trail effect
• There is a known issue for transferring damage, to fix use console toggle " swep_stock_damage 1"
• PhysicalBullets are attempting to be engineered to work with Bullet time binds, the physics is challenging

Backwards compatibility with CSShootBullet function integrated




CROSSHAIR SPECIFICS
================================================== ==================================================

Crosshairs disappear when swep is empty.
Crosshairs become a dot for Ironsights.

swep_reload_rate - console command for setting over all weaoon reload rates (part of formulas)
swep_tracer # - console command for setting a tracer type over all weapons
Tracers[1] = "AR2Tracer"
Tracers[2] = "AirboatGunHeavyTracer"
Tracers[3] = "AirboatGunTracer"
Tracers[4] = "Tracer" -- STOCK TRACER, Looks good
Tracers[5] = "StriderTracer"
Tracers[6] = "HelicopterTracer"
Tracers[7] = "GunshipTracer"
Tracers[8] = "LaserTracer" -- Hard to see head on




CONSOLE COMMANDS
================================================== ==================================================

swep_cone - when debugging is enabled, forces a cone for all weapons
swep_physical_bullets - console command to toggle physical bullets [FIXED & WORKING!]
swep_IronSights_FromFile *Keep off*
cl_swep_FOV - console commands for client FOV
swep_AutoReload - console command to toggle auto reload functionality
swep_stock_damage - toggles the damage mode for physical bullets, keep it 1


cl_crosshair_r - crosshair red
cl_crosshair_g - crosshair green
cl_crosshair_b - crosshair blue
cl_crosshair_a - crosshair alpha

cl_crosshair_scale - Crosshair scale (-1 to disable and use stock)
cl_crosshair_l - crosshair length (30 is default)
cl_crosshair_t - crosshair TOGGLE on or off
cl_crosshair_type - crosshair type

12 - 15 are planned but not yet designed, so they too are nothing

• The color of the inside circle can't currently be changed! Planned to come!

Generating sweps using this base
================================================== ==================================================
Creating new sweps using this base is easy!
The creation for a swep file is done normally with only a few extra (and optional) tags and weapon_fiery_base

If you don't want to use tags, consider using a different base:

weapon_fiery_base_dual
weapon_fiery_base_melee
weapon_fiery_base_pistol
weapon_fiery_base_rifle
weapon_fiery_base_shotgun
weapon_fiery_base_smg
weapon_fiery_base_sniper
weapon_fiery_base_templated -- Used by template (Not available in DL), Good for cookie cutter weapon creation

Technical Notes and Disclosures
================================================== ==================================================
1. This addon will overwrite weapon_cs_base
• This version is only slightly different and should not break any code based on cs_base

2. This base has not been tested on servers. Some CL/SV solutions are in works!

3. SWEP.Primary.DefaultClip and SWEP.Secondary.DefaultClip have become OBSOLETE! Default Clips are calculated in the base for simplicity. Usining DefaultClip WILL glitch custom made SWEPS!!

4. Stock CS_base weapons are overwrote when using this download for easier game and map integration's with this weapon pack

6. MISSING TEXTURES: Dual 357's
• This fix will be for the models pack on workshop!
